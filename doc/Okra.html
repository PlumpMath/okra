<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p class="first">Whenever I refer to directories, file names or commands issued on the
computer they will be written in <code>monospace and verbatim</code>.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p class="first">Write software that automatically generates Common Lisp (CL) bindings
for Ogre.</p>

<p>Ogre is a 3D graphics library written in C++.  This means that we'll
have to generate code for CFFI (my chosen FFI) in CL and we'll have to
generate C wrapper code for Ogre's C++ classes and methods since
talking directly to C++ is riddled with problems (which not be further
discussed in this document).</p>

<p><em>Both the generated C++ code as well as the CL code should be human
readable and produce as little warnings as possible when compiling!
(When having to choose between the generated code being readable and
the code of the bindings generator being readable I have given the
former priority.  I'm not so sure whether it's a good choice but time
will tell...)</em></p>

<p>The bindings should be a usable subset of Ogre's API, enough to create
a game.  Due to various reasons (time, man power, differences between
C++ and CL) it is probably not possible to ever automatically generate
complete bindings to the Ogre API.</p>

<p><em>At the time of this writing I am not anymore working exclusively on
Okra.  I do use Okra in my private projects and through that it will
slowly grow.</em></p>


<h3>Running the examples</h3>

<p class="first">What you need and should know to get the examples running.</p>

<h4>General</h4>

<p class="first">The startup scripts (the <code>*.sh</code> and <code>*.bat</code> files) expect to be run from
the <code>examples</code> directory.</p>


<h4>Linux</h4>

<p class="first">All examples expect Ogre to be installed so download the source from:
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/download/source">http://www.ogre3d.org/download/source</a> (you'll need &quot;OGRE 1.6.x Source
for Linux / OSX&quot;).</p>

<p>Configure, compile and install in <code>/usr/local</code>.  Ogre has some
dependencies which need to be installed first.  Also, see here for
more information on the whole process:
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Building_From_Source#Linux">http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Building_From_Source#Linux</a></p>


<p>The Linux startup scripts are written and tested using SBCL
(1.0.25.debian at the time of writing) and expect to find <code>sbcl</code> in the
path.</p>

<p>They expect to find the necessary Ogre libraries in
<code>/usr/local/lib/OGRE</code> and all others in the <code>lib</code> directory of the Okra
distribution.</p>

<p>All these options are set in the <code>*.sh</code> files and can be changed there.</p>


<h4>Windows</h4>

<p class="first">All examples depend on the Ogre SDK to be installed so download it
from: <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk">http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk</a> (you'll need &quot;OGRE 1.6.x SDK
for Code::Blocks + MinGW C++ Toolbox&quot;).</p>

<p>Copy the following libraries from <code>&lt;ogre-sdk&gt;/bin/Release</code> to the Okra
<code>lib</code> directory: <code>cg.dll</code>, <code>OgreMain.dll</code>, <code>OIS.dll</code>,
<code>Plugin_CgProgramManager.dll</code>, <code>Plugin_OctreeSceneManager.dll</code>,
<code>RenderSystem_Direct3D9.dll</code> and <code>RenderSystem_GL.dll</code>.</p>

<p>The Windows startup scripts are written and tested using Clozure CL
and expect to find <code>wx86cl</code> in the path.</p>

<p>All libraries are expected to be found in the <code>lib</code> directory of the
Okra distribution.</p>

<p>All these settings are in the <code>*.bat</code> files and can be changed there.</p>


<h4>Compiling libokra yourself</h4>

<p class="first">If the libokra library that comes with the Okra distribution doesn't
work you'll need to compile it yourself.  You'll need CMake for that:
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html</a></p>

<p>If you have installed CMake on Linux you should issue: <code>cmake -G &quot;Unix
Makefiles&quot;</code></p>

<p>If you're on Windows you should read the <a href="#windows-mingw">Windows (MinGW)</a> chapter.</p>


<h4>Examples</h4>

<p class="first">Start with the simplest example first: <code>simple-okra</code>.</p>

<p>If that works try the <code>physics-and-input</code> example. This example depends
on both Buclet and clois-lane which you can find at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/buclet/">http://common-lisp.net/project/buclet/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/clois-lane/">http://common-lisp.net/project/clois-lane/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure both are installed correctly and if you're on Windows copy
over the DLLs from both the Buclet and clois-lane <code>lib</code> directories to
the Okra <code>lib</code> directory.  If you're on Linux copy over the
<code>libclois-lane.so</code> file from the clois-lane <code>lib</code> directory to Okra's <code>lib</code>
directory.</p>

<p>If you don't want to copy over library files for the above examples
you'll need to make sure the OS can find them.  (By adapting the
example startup scripts for example.)</p>


<h2><a name="windows-mingw" id="windows-mingw"></a>Windows (MinGW)</h2>

<p class="first">If your libs directory is empty you'll either to download them from
the homepage or you can try to compile them yourself in which case
you'll need to download and install MinGW, MSYS and CMake:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>CMake</strong></dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html#latest">http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html#latest</a></dd>
<dt><strong>MinGW</strong></dt>
<dd><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&amp;package_id=240780">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&amp;package_id=240780</a></dd>
<dt><strong>MSYS</strong></dt><dd>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&amp;package_id=24963">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&amp;package_id=24963</a>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=2435&amp;filename=MSYS-1.0.10.exe&amp;a=14697658">http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=2435&amp;filename=MSYS-1.0.10.exe&amp;a=14697658</a></p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Install MinGW first and then MSYS.  Use MSYS version 1.0.10. There's
guides and information on <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</a> if
needed. (<a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/HOWTO_Install_the_MinGW_GCC_Compiler_Suite">http://www.mingw.org/wiki/HOWTO_Install_the_MinGW_GCC_Compiler_Suite</a>)</p>

<p>I suggest first trying the libraries that come with Okra and only then
the MinGW route unless you're familiar with the latter.</p>

<p>You will need the DLLs from the OgreSDK.  You can download the SDK at:
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk">http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk</a>
You need the Code::Blocks + MinGW version (which is currently at version 1.6.1 but this doesn't matter).  You will need at least the following DLLs (from <code>bin/Release</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>cg.dll</code></li>
<li><code>OgreMain.dll</code></li>
<li><code>OIS.dll</code></li>
<li><code>Plugin_CgProgramManager.dll</code></li>
<li><code>Plugin_OctreeSceneManager.dll</code></li>
<li><code>RenderSystem_Direct3D9.dll</code></li>
<li><code>RenderSystem_GL.dll</code></li>
</ul>

<p>and ofcourse: <code>libokra.dll</code> (and <code>libclois-lane.dll</code> if you want to run
the demo that depends on clois-lane).  These last two you will need to
compile for yourself.</p>

<p>The CMake scripts do not find Ogre correctly on MinGW yet so you'll
have to check <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> in the Okra directory and change it to
point to the correct locations (the two lines below &quot;if (MINGW)&quot;).</p>

<p>If all of this is done you can issue: <code>cmake -G &quot;MSYS Makefiles&quot;</code> (not
&quot;MinGW Makefiles&quot;!)</p>

<p>And then: <code>make</code>.</p>

<p>And if everything goes right (probably not) it should end up in the
<code>lib</code> directory.</p>



<h2>Okra Bindings Generator</h2>

<h3>Generating and testing new bindings</h3>

<p class="first">My modus operandi when working on the bindings generator is from
within Emacs.  I start up Slime with <code>M-x slime</code> and change the
current directory to that of the bindings generator with <code>M-x slime-cd</code>.</p>

<p>Once I made some changes to the source I do a <code>(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op
:okra-bindings-generator)</code> in Slime and place the files in the Okra
root directory with <code>bin/rsync-generated-bindings.sh</code> (this is from
within the <code>bindings-generator</code> directory).</p>

<p>I use rsync because it will only replace the files that have been
changed so that <code>make</code> and the CL implementation only have to recompile
those changed files which saves a lot of time.  Sometimes this leads
to problems however and I do <code>bin/install-generated-bindings.sh</code> which
replaces all the bindings files.  (It also deletes the <code>.fasl</code> files
which shouldn't be really necessary.)</p>

<p>Then I issue a <code>make</code> from the Okra root directory to create the new C
wrapper libraries and after that I run one of the examples.
(<code>./physics-and-input.sh</code> from the <code>examples</code> directory at the time of
writing since I do not have regression tests yet.)</p>




<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p class="verse">
Q. Why are both LOOP and ITER (package ITERATE) are being used?<br>
<br>
A. When I started programming Common Lisp I preferred ITER, but lately<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've come to appreciate LOOP, if only because it means less<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dependencies when writing libraries for public consumption.  Ofcourse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this argument isn't of much use when using both in a library.<br>
